          <p style = "margin-top: .5em">My name is Nick Connor. I am originally a Mechanical Engineer from The Ohio State University, and I am currently pursuing a career in software development.
            I am furthering my education at a coding BootCamp in Columbus, OH called Tech Elevator. It is a rigorous 14-Week Bootcamp where I am developing my skills as a Full-Stack web developer, specializing in Java.
            I am drawn to the world of computer programming because of the breadth of opportunity and the impact that software development has on nearly every aspect society. 
            I'm fascinated by the different ways that coding can allow something as mechanical in nature as a computer to be given new life and my curiosity has drawn me to the industry.
            This is a collection of some of the projects that I have worked on since beginning my journey into the world of software development and I will continue to update this site as my skills continue to grow.</p>
