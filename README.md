This is a WIP webpage to host my personal portfolio of work.

Current job information is out of date and the styling could use a lot of work.
Haven't revisited much since 2017, when I had ~ a month of CSS experience.

Initialized: Oct-09-2017

See my Github for a more up to date view of my skillset while I make adjustments to this page.
